#### Build A Weblog!
With version 1.0 of Meteor having been released, the Meteor Cookbook is getting a rewrite to bring all of it's examples and recipes up to 1.0 status.  The default application that all the examples build towards is creating a weblog; which can then be used as the basis of self-publishing, online journals & diaries, bulletin board systems, chat rooms, advocacy platforms, electronic medical records, personal health & fitness records, quantified-self applications, or any other application that might need a weblog.  (Edit:  the rewrite is still in progress, and all the pieces of the weblog are still being put together.  Expect a finished weblog example in mid February!)
